This is a website I made to help you find your next favorite video game. It's built with just basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site asks you five simple questions to figure out what you're looking forâ€”like the genre, your mood, how much time you have, what system you play on, and whether you want a solo or multiplayer game. After you answer, it searches through a built-in list of 75 games and picks out the top five that you'll probably enjoy. The whole thing has a really calm and modern vibe, with a nice green and cream color scheme, and it works perfectly on any device, whether it's your computer, tablet, or phone.
